          Juan Rivera Perez—better known as JRP—was born in Salinas, California in 2000, into a
          low-income, first-generation Mexican immigrant family. Growing up, he was constantly
          aware of the boundaries his environment tried to impose. But instead of letting those
          boundaries define him, he made it his mission to break them. From a young age, Juan knew
          that if he wanted to do something big, he had to bet on fast-growing, high-impact
          opportunities. At his core, all he’s ever wanted is to make an impact and help people.

          Salinas was built on agriculture, and that’s where Juan first saw opportunity. He realized
          that technology in agriculture could change lives and open doors. At 18, in 2018, he began
          working in ag-tech while preparing to study business and entrepreneurship at Cal Poly San
          Luis Obispo. During his time at Cal Poly, Juan didn’t just study entrepreneurship—he lived
          it. He started a new company every single year, convinced that entrepreneurship was the
          path to unlocking his potential and creating lasting change.

          In 2021, he discovered NBA Top Shot and fell headfirst into the world of crypto. That
          single moment opened the rabbit hole: first collecting, then advising, and eventually
          building. Juan became an advisor and co-founder of a crypto gaming guild tied to Axie
          Infinity, then served as Head of Partnerships at ReNFT, one of the first NFT infrastructure
          companies. Not long after, he founded Revv, a platform bridging Web2 and Web3 analytics
          for creators—helping them understand their audiences and build the future of marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Juan is helping lead the business at Thirdweb, one of the fastest-growing companies
          in Web3. This role has only deepened his understanding of blockchain technology and where
          it’s headed. But titles alone don’t define him. Juan is an innovator, a philosopher, a
          politician, and a leader—someone who refuses to be comforted by comfort, and instead finds
          comfort in growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          His story isn’t finished—it’s just beginning. Every day, Juan pushes forward not only to
          build his own legacy, but to lay the foundation for a world where others can build theirs
          too.
